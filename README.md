The newly redesigned resizing controls in Sketch 44 gives us more flexibility when designing responsive layouts. We design a general responsive grid template based on this specific feature. Now you can resize the artboard to change the layout correspondingly. (The default demension of the artboard is the min width/height within the media query).
